### Python 2 vs Python 3
While there are a number of major differences between the versions the majority of libraries and tools that we are concerned with operate on both. Most changes in Python 3 concern the internal workings and performance. Though, there are some syntax changes, and some operations behave differently. This pages offers a comprehensive look at the key changes: http://sebastianraschka.com/Articles/2014_python_2_3_key_diff.html

We provide both versions on our cluster: the binaries `python` and `python2` for Python 2.7, and `python3` for version 3.4.

**All assignments are expected to run on Python 2.7**

## Assignment 2:  HW02
Follow the instructions in the [HW02/README.md](HW02/README.md) file.
